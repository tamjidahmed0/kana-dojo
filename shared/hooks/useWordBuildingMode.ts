 * Smart algorithm to decide when to trigger word building mode in pick games.
 * Uses a weighted probability that increases word building chance as user improves.
 *
 * Word Building Mode has 2 flavors:
 * - Normal: Multiple kana chars displayed, user selects romaji tiles
 * - Reverse: Multiple romaji chars displayed, user selects kana tiles
 *
 * - Base probability starts at 15%
 * - Increases by 10% for each consecutive correct answer
 * - Caps at 40% word building probability
 * - Requires minimum 3 consecutive correct answers before it can trigger
 * - After 2 correct answers in word building mode, may switch back to normal pick
 * - Direction (normal/reverse) is decided randomly with bias toward variety
