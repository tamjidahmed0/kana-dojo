/**
 * Adaptive Weighted Selection System
 *
 * This system prioritizes characters the user struggles with while ensuring
 * a balanced learning experience. Key features:
 *
 * 1. Sigmoid-based weight calculation for smooth, bounded adjustments
 * 2. Recency tracking - recently missed characters get priority that decays
 * 3. Streak awareness - consecutive misses compound weight with diminishing returns
 * 4. Minimum floor - mastered characters still appear occasionally
 * 5. Exploration factor - ensures variety even among difficult characters
 * 6. Persistent storage using localforage (IndexedDB) for large datasets
